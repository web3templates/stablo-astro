Welcome to my comprehensive study guide designed to help you master Flask! This guide is divided into multiple modules, each focusing on a specific topic related to Flask, such as routing, database interactions, API development, and more.

Each module includes a **Study Goal** to clarify what you should aim to learn, **Topics to Cover** that list the key points you'll focus on, and a **Lab** exercise to apply what you've learned.
