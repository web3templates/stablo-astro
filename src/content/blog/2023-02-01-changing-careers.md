  **Changing careers** is exciting and intimidating, and some people think that starting a new job is challenging and impossible for adults and seniors. I was a geologist long ago, but I am changing my major from geology to software development. There are two reasons why I am changing careers: first, my long-term goals have changed, and second, I realized that dealing with software and data is my passion.

First, I decided to change careers because my long-term goals have changed. I was born in Venezuela, where I got my degree as a geologist and started a family. However, Venezuela's political and economic crisis is worsening, so I decided to create a new life abroad. I began to work at Amazon in the United States in 2020, and I have enrolled in the Amazon Career Program, which allows employees to work and study part-time careers. Thanks to the Amazon Career Program, I have gotten my GED and language certificate, and next October, I will get my certification as a Full Stack Developer.

Second, after several years of working with databases and geostatistical modeling software, I realized that my current passion is working with programming languages, software, and websites. As a result, I decided to pursue a software development career.

I have studied at Flatiron School for about a month >and learned basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript concepts and methods. I'll try my best.
